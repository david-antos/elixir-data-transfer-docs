Prerequisities to generate RCAuth.eu certificates
=================================================

If you need to create RCAuth.eu proxy certificates, you have to be a member
of a particular virtual organisation to be able to do so.

Use your ELIXIR credentials to log in the following application and submit
it: 
https://perun.elixir-czech.cz/registrar/?vo=elixir&group=EGI:vo.elixir-europe.org

Expect a mail confirmation that your application has been submitted and
later another confirmation that it was accepted. Shortly after this, you'll
be able to generate proxy certificates in ELIXIR.

Note that membership in this virtual organisation is managed manually.
Primary manager is Steven Newhouse. It can be also approved by Michal
Prochazka.
